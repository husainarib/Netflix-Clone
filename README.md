# Netflix Clone!
Built using Vue 3, Pinia, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, this project is a responsive web app that mimics the core browsing functionality of Netflix. Users can scroll through a selection of movies, each displaying a poster image, title, and description. When clicking on a movie, the app routes to a dynamic details page with additional info and a trailer video. 

Under the hood, Vue 3 handles the reactive UI while Pinia is implemented for state management. Tailwind CSS is leveraged for rapid styling based on utility classes. Vite enables quick development through its hot module replacement.
